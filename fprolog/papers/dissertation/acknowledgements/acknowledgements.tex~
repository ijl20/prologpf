This work has benefited greatly from the supervision of William Clocksin,
and discussion with my colleagues in Austin 316 in the University of
Cambridge Computer Laboratory.
I am grateful to the University for providing an environment so conducive
to creative effort, and hope the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences
Research Council feel their funding has been well spent.

The work would not have been possible without the tolerance of my
wife Mary and daughter Kitty, and their love and humour have brightened
even the darkest days.  To them I owe this PhD.
